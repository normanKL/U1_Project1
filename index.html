            <p class="services_des">Counseling is a collaborative effort between the counselor and client. Professional counselors help clients identify goals and potential solutions to problems which cause emotional turmoil; seek to improve communication and coping skills; strengthen self-esteem; and promote behavior change and optimal mental health.</p>
            <p class="services_des">Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders, among which are affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities. A medical doctor specialising in psychiatry is a psychiatrist. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question.</p>
            <p class="services_des">Clinical Hypnotherapy is an amazingly effective therapy to help a person break habits and create new lifestyles based on their priorities. It is one of the most pleasant and relaxing natural therapies, and it utilises hypnosis as a gentle tool for powerful healing transformation.</p>
